# Sathkakra

Health sector of Sri Lanka has been affected severely due to the current economic crisis. One of the major issues is the lack of pharmaceuticals. 160 out of 383 essential medicines in Sri Lanka are considered in short supply.

Sathkara is a dedicated platform that enables patients to find the medicines they need easily and much faster. It aims to connect the patients with parties who can supply medicine. A patient can register a new account and add a new post requesting for a medicine in need. A post includes details like drug name, description, urgency, location, contact details for each patient. User who are able to supply medicine or has the knowledge of medicine availability can help the patient by contacting him/her to provide the medicine.
